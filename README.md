# hyper-terrain
A blindingly-fast random noise and terrain generator.

I'm mainly going to use this for my game development and planet simulations.

## TODOs

- [ ] Pretty contour lines
- [ ] Basic terrain coloring
- [ ] Land generation animations
- [ ] Rivers
- [ ] Wind/weather/climate
- [ ] Erosion
