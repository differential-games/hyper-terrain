### Why Go?

*"Optimized C++ is faster than optimized Go, but it's much easier to write optimized Go."*

- My day job is mainly in Go, so this helps me hone my skills.
- It's far easier to write near-optimal code in Go than in other languages.
- Sharing Go code is easy.

### Why fast?

There's no practical reason.
It's fun; it's a challenge.
